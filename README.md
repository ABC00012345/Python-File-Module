---------------
Python-File-Module
---------------

Use this library as your own risiko:
    This library is created to combine the -shutil- module and the -os- module
    It's created for write on files, delete files, and read files

How to use:
    Download the full zip and extract it. Make sure your file.py is in same folder of the setup.
    The setup copies the file.py to the directory of your local python libs.
    To use it just write in the beginning of your code: (import file).
    You can also make it manually. Copy file.py in your python libs. They are normally at: C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\Lib
    Linux and Mac setup will is coming...



Thanks for using
